# Compat information
## Dedicated Compat
**Better Combat** dedicated and integrated support  
  But Better Combat sadly has a bug with NBT based Compat. We recommend using https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat-nbt-fix for multiplayer
**Epic Fight** weapons are mostly supported, armor sadly is not  
**Apoli** is Origins power api, we have support via a property, allowing developers to use any apolipowers on modular items  
## Generated Material Info
Truly Modular attempts to make any mods Tool Materials compatible.
This is done by scanning a Mods tools and trying to match their stats.
Most mods should work with this system.
- **Reqirements**  
A Sword and an Axe implement as the same Toolfamily.
- **Exceptions**  
Some mods sadly implement their Tools differently/weirdly and dont get detected because of that.
In addition right click abilities and on-hit effects or similar effects cant be automaticly detected sadly
- **Quirks**  
Sometimes the texturing or Naming of the Generated Material may be odd, this is simply due to the generative nature.
  
## Make your own Compat  
  
If some compat is still missing you can try to your own hand at it with the [Material Helper](https://truly-modular.github.io/Material-Helper/)
This is a Website that lets anybody make compat materials for Truly Modular, even without any coding knowledge.
