# 1.21 Technical Changes
This is a Prototype document. 1.21 is not yet final.  
This Document only is for Datapack Changes.
The Java changes are too significant to list.
## Module.json
- module names are deprecated.  
this concept is replaced with path based IDs  
  blade_sword -> arsenal:blade/normal  
  this means skins, synergies and co need to be adjusted
- the translation key changed
miapi.module.blade_normal -> miapi.module.arsenal.blade.normal
## Material.json
- material keys and translation are deprecated.  
  this concept is replaced with path based IDs  
  iron -> miapi:metal/iron  
  test-mod:metal/iron will be translated by miapi.material.test-mod.metal.iron
- the [translate.material] concept has been deprecated. For module translations simply use %s now
## Converters.json
- the module format on the Item has changes significantly and the converter format reflects that. We recommend checking Arsenals converters for more details
## Properties
- Properties no longer support Uppercase letters.
- in addition their system has been moved to a ID system, technically all properties are now miapi:model instead of model, but when no ModID is given miapi is defaulted.
  this has been done to make the api more extendable while avoiding collisions

- itemId -> item_id

  this property is a map ability_id -> ability context
