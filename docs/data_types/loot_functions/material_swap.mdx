# Material Swap Loot Function

## Description

 The `MaterialSwapLootFunction` is a loot function  
that randomizes the materials of a modular item when generatedas loot. This function compares the itemâ€™s materials with a specified materialand replaces it with a new one based on several configurable parameters.These parameters control the bounds, mining level, tier, hardness, and flexibilityfactors that influence the selection of substitute materials.Additionally, the function can filter materials usinga whitelist or blacklist to limit or exclude certain materials from substitution.This allows for very random items within the loot-pool that still retain roughly the same strength level* Its full ID is ```"miapi:material_swap"```

## Data

- **material**:  An optional material ID to substitute, if not set the highest found material will be used instead
- **lower_bounds**:  An optional (default = -3) double that sets the lower bound of acceptable material differences for substitution.
- **upper_bounds**:  An optional (default = +0.5) double that sets the upper bound of acceptable material differences for substitution.
- **mining_level_factor**:  An optional (default = 1.0) double that adjusts the impact of the mining level on material substitution.
- **tier_factor**:  An optional (default = 1.0) double that influences the selection of materials based on their tier level.
- **hardness_factor**:  An optional double (default = 1.0) that influences the selection of materials based on their hardness.
- **flexibility_factor**:  An optional (default = 1.0) double that adjusts material substitution based on flexibility values.
- **chance**:  An optional (default = 1.0) that sets the chance for a swap to occur in the first place.
- **blacklist**:  An optional list of Material IDs representing materials that cannot be substituted.
- **whitelist**:  An optional list of Material IDs, if set blocks all entries not on this list.
