# Loot Functions

## Description

Loot Functions are functions within minecraft that can adjust Items for loot within any loot table.  
You can read up on them on the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Loot_table),  
or visit [misodes beautifull site](https://misode.github.io/loot-table/) to help with understanding their structure.  
Truly Modular introduces new loot functions to diversify and modularise looted items dynamically.
