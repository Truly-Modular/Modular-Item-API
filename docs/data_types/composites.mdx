# Composite Material

## Description

 The Composite Material allows defining a material as a combination of multiple composites. Each composite modifies the base material in a specific way,  
such as changing its color, name, or attributes. This enables dynamic material creation by layering different modifications.<p>A composite material consists of a base material and a list of composite modifications that transform the base into a fully functional material.These composites can adjust properties like durability, visual appearance or any other Material based system.<p><p>The final material is computed by applying the list of composites in sequence to an initial default material.

## Data

- **composite_material**:  A list of composite modifications that define how the material is built from its base.
