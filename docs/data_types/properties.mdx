# Properties

## Description

 Properties are the main way any stat is assigned to anything  
They are usually found in an id -> data map like``` json{"miapi:fire_proof":true}```Note that in this example "miapi" can be removed as it is implied if no mod id is setMost Properties have more complex inner data than a boolean
