# Fake Enchantment Property

## Description

 The Fake Enchantment Property simulates enchantment levels on items during specific operations.  
These enchantments are not shown in the item's tooltip and are purely functional.The property evaluates enchantment levels dynamically using the `[old_level]` placeholder, which allows referencing prior levels in the calculation.Once the property is removed, the enchantments no longer affect the item.

## Data

- **enchantment**:  The fake enchantment being applied (Holder<Enchantment>).
- **value**:  DoubleOperationResolvable, which defines how the level of the fake enchantment is calculated.
