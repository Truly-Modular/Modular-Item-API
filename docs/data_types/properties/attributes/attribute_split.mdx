# Attribute Split Property

## Description

 The Attribute Split Property is used to divide attributes across different contexts.  
It enables assigning attributes to multiple slots and merging them based on a percentage split.This Doesnt by default remove the attribute, if you wish to remove the existing attribute you need to split that attribute inwith the percentage -100This property is essential to re-balance certain attributes for usage with other mods like alembic.This Example would give 20% of the weapons attack damage as offhand damage```json"attribute_split": {  "minecraft:generic.attack_damage": {    "mainhand": [      {        "attribute": "minecraft:generic.attack_damage",        "percentage": "20",        "target":"offhand"      }    ]  }}```
