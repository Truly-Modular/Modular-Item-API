# Mining Shape Property

## Description

  
The MiningShapeProperty controls how tools mine multiple blocks based on the configured mining shapes, conditions, and modes.This allows for varied mining behaviors such as mining entire veins or large areas with a single action. *The property supports different mining shapes (e.g., cubes, veins), conditions (e.g., block tags, always mine), and modes (e.g., instant, staggered).It also incorporates mining modifiers that can influence mining behavior, such as requiring all blocks to be the same type.

## Data

- **mining_modes**:  instant or staggered exist by default
- **mining_conditions**:  always and block_tag exist by default
- **mining_modifiers**: require_same exists by default
