# Can Change Parent Module Property

## Description

  
The Can Change Parent Module Property validates if a module's parent can be changed by checking specified conditions.If the conditions are not met, the change is disallowed, and a failure reason is communicated. This is particularlyimportant in crafting or upgrading scenarios where a module's placement or modification depends on parent-childrelationships between modules.

## Data

- **allow_change_parent**:  A condition that determines whether a parent module can be changed.
- **`condition`**:  The condition that must be met to allow changing the parent module.
