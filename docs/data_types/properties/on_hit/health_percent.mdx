# Health Percent Damage Property

## Description

 The Health Percent Damage Property adds extra damage to a target based on the percentage of their current health. This means that the lower the target's health, the more damage they will receive from the attack.  
This property is useful for creating weapons or effects that scale their damage relative to the health of the target, making them more effective against low-health enemies.The additional damage is calculated as a percentage of the target's current health, providing a dynamic scaling effect during combat.It is recommended to use this sparingly, since against modded bosses this might escalate fairly quickly!

## Data

- **value**:  The percentage of the target's current health that is added as extra damage. For example, a value of 10 means an additional 10% of the target's current health is added to the damage dealt.
